    #### Description:
    C A T T O R U N N E R is a nostalgic project that draws inspiration from my childhood gaming experiences. The game was heavily inspired by the classic "Lonely T-Rex," the iconic offline browser game, but with     a modern twist and a personalized aesthetic. Designed using the pygame library, this project is a blend of creativity, technical implementation, and dedication.

    What sets C A T T O R U N N E R apart is its simplicity in coding architecture. The entire project was developed using functions rather than object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes. This design choice      stems from my current learning journey—I am still growing my understanding of classes and object-oriented design. By opting for a function-based approach, I aimed to focus on the mechanics and gameplay design     without overwhelming myself. Despite this, the game operates smoothly, and its relatively small size allowed me to manage the architecture effectively.
    
    The visual aspect of the game is where my creativity truly shines. All the pixel art, from the main character to the enemies and the background, was hand-drawn by me using Aseprite, a powerful pixel art tool.     The animations were meticulously designed, with each frame adjusted to ensure smooth and engaging motion. Creating the game’s custom main menu was particularly enjoyable, as it allowed me to combine my art         skills with game mechanics. The animations in the menu, including the transitions and interactive buttons, are all hand-crafted.
    
    The background art also required significant attention to detail. I wanted the game to feel immersive and vibrant, so I invested time in designing backgrounds that complement the gameplay while maintaining        the overall aesthetic. Fitting hand-drawn characters and objects perfectly within the game window was a challenging task, as it required precise adjustments to ensure proper alignment and collision detection.
    
    On the technical side, pygame's features played a crucial role in bringing my vision to life. I imported images and assets using pygame’s built-in functions and carefully calculated the movements of the main      character, especially the jump mechanics. For the enemies, I stored their data in a list and used iterative logic for spawning them dynamically. This approach added an element of unpredictability, making the      gameplay more engaging.
    
    To enhance the game’s functionality, I implemented multiple timers. These timers were essential for managing various aspects, including calculating the player’s score, controlling character animations, and        scheduling enemy spawn events. This modular timing system made the game flexible and responsive, ensuring a seamless gaming experience. Collision detection was another critical aspect of the development           process. I used rectangle-based collision checks to ensure that every interaction between the player and obstacles was precise and accurate.
    
    The game is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward. To start playing, users simply press the SPACE key on the custom menu screen. Once the game begins, the objective is to avoid colliding with           enemies while progressing to achieve a higher score. The controls are intuitive, making the game accessible to players of all skill levels.
    
    One of the most exciting parts of the development process was incorporating audio into the game. I added background music that complements the retro-modern theme of the game, along with specific sound effects     for jumping, collisions, and other interactions. These audio elements bring an extra layer of immersion and make the gameplay more engaging.
    
    While developing C A T T O R U N N E R, I encountered several challenges, particularly when integrating hand-drawn assets into the game environment. Achieving the right balance between aesthetics and             functionality required patience and experimentation. Despite these hurdles, the process was incredibly rewarding, as it allowed me to refine my skills and bring my ideas to life.
    
    Overall, C A T T O R U N N E R is more than just a game—it’s a personal project that reflects my growth as a developer and artist. From creating pixel art to implementing game mechanics without relying on         classes, every aspect of this project has been a learning experience. The result is a game that captures the nostalgic charm of "Lonely T-Rex" while offering a fresh and modern take.
